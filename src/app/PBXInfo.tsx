      <h2>Understanding Hosted and Virtual PBX Systems</h2>
      <p>Hosted PBX systems provide a complete enterprise-level phone system. They replace traditional phone systems and use IP phones with all communications going through an internet-connected router.</p>
      <p>Virtual PBX systems, on the other hand, primarily handle incoming calls and provide routing options to various locations or employees. They are typically suited for smaller businesses or startups.</p>
      <h3>Key Considerations:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bandwidth Requirements: Ensure your internet connection can handle the data and voice traffic.</li>
        <li>Service Provider Reliability: Choose providers with a good track record and reliable service.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Needs: Consider the need for IP phones and proper setup of network routers.</li>
      </ul>
